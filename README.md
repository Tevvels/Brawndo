# Brawndo

## Description

Brawndo is an app that allows you to track the needs of your plant. How many people kill their plant because they just can’t remember to water it? Our apps goal is to track all of your plants and ensure that none of them go without watering at the right time.

Our main challenge was updating the handlebars with dynamic materials and getting the droplets to be their own objects.

We had many successes in this project! Not only did our group work together well on challenges, we also had no issues with our git branches. Our backend team pulled together our routes and data tables right off the bat and our front end team had a lot of success making an adorable site.

## Usage

The user experience is incredibly simple. The user adds their plant to the database and the droplet then tracks when the plant needs water. When the drop is empty, the user will know it's time to water their plant. They will then click the droplet to reset the timer!
